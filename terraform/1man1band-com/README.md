# README

setup for [1man1band.com](https://1man1band.com)

This is deployed on GH pages from [digital-harbor-josh](https://github.com/pypeaday/digital-harbor-josh)

# TODO

move this to cloudflare pages by brining the index.html from the repo into here. Can keep his custom domain but I can remove a whole repo from my profile
