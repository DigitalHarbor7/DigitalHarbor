## Sales Pitch

Problem: You want a simple website to serve as a one-stop shop for all the
links related to you - YouTube, Patreon, Venmo, Show Calendar, Google Review, etc. You'd also
like a kick-awesome QR Code for your followers to simply scan and be brought to
that site... But you aren't sure where to start!

I'm here to help by building your [Digital Harbor](https://mydigitalharbor.com)

The cost to build your site is one-time fee of $100, and I remain available for edits and discussion. From there the options are...

1. hand it off to you and you handle hosting
2. host it at `https://mydigitalharbor.com/{Your Route}` for $5/month. [Example](https://mydigitalharbor.com/1man1-band)
3. host it at a custom domain: $100 Domain Setup (DNS, SSL, etc.) + $10/month + Domain Cost [1man1band.com](https://1man1band.com)
